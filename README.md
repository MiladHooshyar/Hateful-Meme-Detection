# HateBlocker
HateBlocker is an API that utilizes deep learning to detect hateful memes from visual and textual information.
# Problem description
The effect of hateful content on social media can be devastating. A result of a recent poll has shown that the majority of US adults consider hateful content a serious problem for which social media companies bear the responsibility of detecting and removing. In this project, I used AI to build a hateful meme detector (HateBlocker) and deployed the model as a stand-alone API and a Chrome extension.
# Data
I used data from Facebook research […] which consists of 8.5K training and 0.5 validation examples. For more information refer to […]. This data set consists of image and caption which I run through a couple of pre-trained features extraction models (see below for details). The features are available at []. For training, these features should be copied in the /data folder.
# Models
This project has been carried out in collaboration with the research team as Clarifai, thus the focus was to use the pre-trained models of the Clarifai platform to extract the image and text features. I also performed experiments inspired by new developments in image and video captioning []
## Baseline
The baseline model is a simple logistic regression that is trained on top of the image and caption features from the Clarifai platform. This simple approach gives AUC-ROC=0.63.
## feature fusion and dense classifier
This classifier is trained on top of several feature sets including image, text, image moderation, text moderation features. The fifth stream of information is supplied by concatenating the top-five concepts of the image to the image caption and then feeding that to the text feature extraction network.

The best performance of this model (after a lot of fine-tuning) is AUC-ROC = 0.71.
Here is also an example that shows how the meaning of a meme changes with modifying either the textual and visual content which highlights the nonlinear interaction of information from image and text.

For deployment, this model is coupled with a google vision OCR (for caption extraction) and is implemented as a Flask API. The API inputs a meme URL and outputs the class probabilities. The end-product of this project is a Chrome extension (HateBlocker) which extracts meme URLs and sends them through the API. HateBlocker then removes those images that are classified as hateful. Here is a short demo!

## Multistream model VisualBert features
There have been several interesting developments in image captioning. I used a recently proposed model called VisualBert [] to extract features from image+caption and build a multi-stream classifier with the addition of features from Clarifai. This model gives AUC-ROC =0.75 of the validation data set.

## MDVC
A very interesting development in video captioning is the recently published work by []. The idea of encoder-decoder architecture via a multiheaded attention connection seems very appealing to the problem of textual and visual feature fusion. I implemented a modified version of MDVC. The best performance with this model with only image and text features is AUC-ROC=0.66. Indeed, better performance can be achieved by incorporating the full set of features to form a stack of encoder-decoder networks [In progress :D].
