# Data
The data for this project comes from [Facebook research](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/hateful-memes-challenge-and-data-set/) which consists of 8.5K training and 0.5 validation, and 1K test examples. This data set consists of image and caption which were run through a couple of pre-trained features extraction models. The features are available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ikgWVV45L7rsgQ6y80721VyyzWnE3fRo/view?usp=sharing). For training, these features should be copied in the [/data](https://github.com/MiladHooshyar/Hateful-Meme-Detection/tree/master/data) folder.
